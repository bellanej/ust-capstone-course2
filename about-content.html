    <h2 class="mb-5">Welcome to my San Francisco guide</h2>
    <p>It all started when me and my husband decided to give San francisco a try for one year. He works in the tech business, so the bay area is the place to be. I had just started studying programming, and was looking for an idea for an application.</p>

    <p>San Francisco is a somewhat mustdo for Swedes. The city lies in California, it's kind of warm and sunny compared to Sweden (even on foggy days), and the culture and vibe is very European. Swedes say want to experience the real USA, but not really. We feel safe around a somewhat liberal and leftish place.</p>

    <p>So this is where my thoughts about a swedish approved San Francisco guide started. I wanted a guide where the users could really trust that the person behind it had excellent taste ;) and could take you to those places that aren't the most famous and common. I know how hard it can be to find the good spots and not the bad</p>

    <p>Enter a school assignment. As an honorary project, I had to make an application, so I thought that this could be a good start for my idea. This is just a template so far, but it's a good start.</p>
